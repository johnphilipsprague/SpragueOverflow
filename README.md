# Sprague Overflow

This project is the portfolio website of John Sprague and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

A personal website designed to showcase information about myself, projects I've created, and technologies I've learned. Built using TypeScript, Sass, and the BEM styling methodology.

## Future Goals

Adding carousel to About Me, Projects, and Skills pages. Expanding on eye catching designs that increase readability.

## Known Bugs

On iPhone 12, buttons appear to be cut off at the top. Possible element collision.
